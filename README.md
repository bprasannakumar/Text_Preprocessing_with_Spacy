# Text_Preprocessing_with_Spacy
This repo contains a notebook which uses spaCy to preprocess text.

SpaCy is a free, open-source, industrial strength library for Natural Language Processing in Python. Using spaCy, we can preprocess text and make it ready for further semantic analysis in a very elegant way.

We can perform the following preprocessing tasks using spaCy:

Tokenization.
Stemming.
Lemmatization.
Removing punctuations.
Removing stop words.
Part of speech tagging.
Word chunking.

Explore the notebook for examples.

# Note: Need to install spacy in your environment in order to execute this notebook.
